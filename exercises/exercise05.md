# Exercise 05: SQLDA Database - Dates, Data Quality, Arrays, and JSON

- Name:
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module:
- Database Used:  `sqlda` (Sample Datasets)
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin or psql)

---

## Instructions

- Use the **sqlda** database from the "Loading the Sample Datasets" instructions.
- For each SQL task:
  - Include your SQL in a fenced code block
  - Execute it and include a **screenshot** showing the query and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.
- For explanation questions:
  - Write your answer in complete sentences
  - Include a screenshot if requested

## Question 1

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show a **list of years** that emails were sent.

Your results should list years like this (order matters):

```
year
2011
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date)::int AS year
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 2

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show the **number of messages sent by year**, ordered by year (as shown in the prompt).

Output should resemble:

```
count   year
...
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date)::int AS year
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 3

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show:
- the **sent date**
- the **opened date**
- the **interval** between the two

Only include emails that contain **both** a sent date and an opened date.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT sent_date, opened_date, opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
AND opened_date IS NOT NULL;
```

## Question 4

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show emails that contain an **opened date BEFORE the sent date**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT email_id, customer_id, sent_date, opened_date, opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
AND opened_date IS NOT NULL
AND opened_date < sent_date;
```

## Question 5

Using the `sqlda` database: there are **over 100 emails** that contain an opened date **BEFORE** the sent date.

After looking at the data, **why is this the case?**

### Answer

These records are a data quality issue in the sample dataset. For those emails, the opened_date timestamps don't correspond to the actual sent_date of that specific message—opened_date is sometimes earlier by months or years. This usually happens when data is generated or joined from different sources without enforcing consistent event order, so an older "open" event gets associated with a newer "send" event. In other words, the timestamps are valid individually, but they don't represent a real "sent and then opened" sequence for that email, which is why the opened date appears before the sent date.

## Question 6

Using the `sqlda` database, explain in your own words what the following code does:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_points AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM customers
    WHERE longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND latitude IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE dealership_points AS (
    SELECT
        dealership_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM dealerships
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_dealership_distance AS (
    SELECT
       customer_id,
       dealership_id,
       c.lng_lat_point <@> d.lng_lat_point AS distance
    FROM customer_points c
    CROSS JOIN dealership_points d
);
```

### Answer

This code builds three temporary tables to compute distances between every customer and every dealership:
- **customer_points** converts each customer's longitude/latitude into a point value, keeping only customers with valid coordinates.
- **dealership_points** does the same for each dealership.
- **customer_dealership_distance** then takes a cross join of all customer points and dealership points and uses the <@> operator to calculate the straight line distance between each customer–dealership pair, storing that distance in a temp table. The result is a full matrix of distances between all customers and all dealerships.

## Question 7

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display an **array of salespeople for each dealership**, sorted by dealership.

For example - dealership 1 is below:

```text
"{""Fidell,Granville"",""Onele,Jereme"",""Sheriff,Lelia"",""McSpirron,Massimiliano"",""Rennick,Nadia"",""Mace,Eveleen"",""Oxteby,Dukie"",""Spong,Marcos"",""Wogden,Quent"",""Duny,Sandye"",""Loraine,Englebert"",""Meere,Ira"",""Gibbens,Cristine"",""Prine,Lyda"",""McCoughan,Sheff"",""Schule,Giselbert"",""McAndie,Eleen"",""Dosedale,Dorie"",""Nafziger,Shay""}"
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT dealership_id,
ARRAY_AGG(
(last_name || ',' || first_name)
ORDER BY salesperson_id
) AS salespeople_array
FROM salespeople
GROUP BY dealership_id
ORDER BY dealership_id;
```

## Question 8

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:
- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state** of the dealership
- the **number of salespeople** for the dealership

Sort by **state**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT d.dealership_id, d.state, COUNT(*) AS count,
ARRAY_AGG(
(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name)
ORDER BY s.salesperson_id
) AS array_agg  
FROM dealerships d
JOIN salespeople s ON d.dealership_id = s.dealership_id
GROUP BY d.dealership_id, d.state
ORDER BY d.state,count;
```

## Question 9

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to convert the **customers** table to **JSON**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT row_to_json(c) AS customer_json
FROM customers c;
```

## Question 10

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:
- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state**
- the **number of salespeople**
- sorted by **state**

Then **convert this result to JSON**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray-1](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray-1.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
WITH dealership_salespeople AS (
SELECT d.dealership_id, d.state, COUNT(*) AS num_salespeople,
ARRAY_AGG(
(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name)
ORDER BY salesperson_id
) AS array_agg
FROM dealerships d
JOIN salespeople s
ON d.dealership_id = s.dealership_id
GROUP BY d.dealership_id, d.state
ORDER BY d.state, num_salespeople
)
SELECT
row_to_json(dealership_salespeople) AS row_to_json
FROM dealership_salespeople;
```
